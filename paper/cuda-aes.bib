	abstract = {Advanced ASIC Chip Synthesis: Using Synopsys® Design Compiler® Physical Compiler® and PrimeTime®, Second Edition describes the advanced concepts and techniques used towards ASIC chip synthesis, physical synthesis, formal verification and static timing analysis, using the Synopsys suite of tools. In addition, the entire ASIC design flow methodology targeted for VDSM (Very-Deep-Sub-Micron) technologies is covered in detail. The emphasis of this book is on real-time application of Synopsys tools, used to combat various problems seen at VDSM geometries. Readers will be exposed to an effective design methodology for handling complex, sub-micron ASIC designs. Significance is placed on HDL coding styles, synthesis and optimization, dynamic simulation, formal verification, DFT scan insertion, links to layout, physical synthesis, and static timing analysis. At each step, problems related to each phase of the design flow are identified, with solutions and work-around described in detail. In addition, crucial issues related to layout, which includes clock tree synthesis and back-end integration (links to layout) are also discussed at length. Furthermore, the book contains in-depth discussions on the basis of Synopsys technology libraries and HDL coding styles, targeted towards optimal synthesis solution. Target audiences for this book are practicing ASIC design engineers and masters level students undertaking advanced VLSI courses on ASIC chip design and DFT techniques.},

	abstract = {GPU exhibits the capability for applications with a high level of parallelism despite its low cost. The support of integer and logical instructions by the latest generation of GPUs enables us to implement cipher algorithms more easily. However, decisions such as parallel processing granularity and memory allocation impose a heavy burden on programmers. Therefore, this paper presents results of several experiments that were conducted to elucidate the relation between memory allocation styles of variables of AES and granularity as the parallelism exploited from AES encoding processes using CUDA with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX285 (Nvidia Corp.). Results of these experiments showed that the 16 bytes/thread granularity had the highest performance. It achieved approximately 35 Gbps throughput. It also exhibited differences of memory allocation and granularity effects around 2\%â€“30\% for performance in standard implementation. It shows that the decision of granularity and memory allocation is the most important factor for effective processing in AES encryption on GPU. Moreover, implementation with overlapping between processing and data transfer yielded 22.5 Gbps throughput including the data transfer time.},

	abstract = {The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifies a FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm is a symmetric block cipher that can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information. Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext; decrypting the ciphertext converts the data back into its original form, called plaintext. The AES algorithm is capable of using cryptographic keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits to encrypt and decrypt data in blocks of 128 bits.},
